# Travel Photography Landing Page 

This is the very first project I built from scratch, using basic HTML, CSS & Vanilla Javascript. Itâ€™s a fun landing page about Travel Photography. The newsletter button is a generator which works by the user entering their name & email, answering some questions and then utilising Javascript to alert their name and thanking them for their subscription. This project was a great way to learn something new while getting to explore a topic I love.
